# NOT WORKING YET

The help screen serves as the outline of things to come.

# MSync
This has the basic features and adds a manifest file, thus “msync”. It aids in synchronizing two active directories, one of them being remote.

Help:
```
./msync.php -H
```

## ~/.*profile

I've added this line to my  ".zprofile" file (MacOS Ventura):

~~~
alias msync=~/Documents/Diskerror/MSync/msync
~~~
So now asking for the help screen goes like:
~~~
msync -H
~~~

## help_page.txt

Read the file “help_page.txt” for what’s planned.
