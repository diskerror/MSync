# MSync

MSync performs the same as simple usage of `rsync` but adds a manifest file. It aids in synchronizing two active directories, one of them being remote. It compares the status of the remote and local directories against status information from the last directory syncronization.

## This code project is still in alpha testing.

### Help:
```
./msync -H
```
or read the file “help_screen.txt” for what’s planned.
