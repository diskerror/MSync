# MSync

MSync performs the same as simple usage of `rsync` but adds a manifest file. It aids in synchronizing two active directories, one of them being remote. This happens with products like [SuiteCRM](https://suitecrm.com) where code is generated by other parts of the package, not just for caching. These files might need to be edited for custom modifications and those modification could write over a newly generated file.

It compares the status of the remote and local directories against status information from the last directory syncronization. File differences are detected by hashing the remote and local contents of code text files that are most likely to edited. Graphics files are uploaded or downloaded if their sizes or mod times differ.

### This code project is still in alpha testing and is buggy.

## Help:
```
./msync -H
```
or read the file “help_screen.txt” for what’s planned.
